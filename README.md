## Goal 

The goal of the test is to check your ability to integrate a design using the following technologies and architecture:
* React
* Typescript
* Ant design
* Styled component

## ToDo

To complete the test you will need to integrate the foolowing page.
You should use [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics) in order to achieve this.
You don't need to make the app dynamic, therefore you can use any data you want to populate the page.

You don't have to deploy the app.

## Basic scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
