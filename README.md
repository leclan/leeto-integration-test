## Goal 

The goal of the test is to check your ability to integrate a design using the following technologies and architecture:
* React
* Typescript
* Ant design
* Styled component

## ToDo

To complete the test you will need to integrate the following page.
You should use [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics) in order to achieve this.
You don't need to make the app dynamic, therefore you can use any data you want to populate the page.

You don't have to deploy the app.

For the design part you need to create a [figma account](https://help.figma.com/article/207-creating-a-figma-account) in order to see the design file.

Your goal is to integrate [this view](https://www.figma.com/file/UDKlhGrPqtxdRGG0xNoVFj/Integration-Test?node-id=1%3A165) with a version with 5 data cards wich can be responsive on a smaller screen like [this](https://www.figma.com/file/UDKlhGrPqtxdRGG0xNoVFj/Integration-Test?node-id=2%3A126).
 
 The grid you will build for the cards need to work for 3 cards instead of 5.
 For 3 data cards, the design on standard screen is [here](https://www.figma.com/file/UDKlhGrPqtxdRGG0xNoVFj/Integration-Test?node-id=2%3A459) and on a smaller screen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/UDKlhGrPqtxdRGG0xNoVFj/Integration-Test?node-id=2%3A613).

Good luck! ðŸ˜Ž
